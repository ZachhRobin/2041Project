To create a new build, type 'dune build' in your ubuntu terminal at the 2041Project directory

In order to print back a file, navigate your terminal to main.exe in a built file and use the command --printback [and then drag your file to the terminal]
    It should look as follows: ./_build/default/declaration/bin/main.exe --printback [INSERT FILE HERE]
